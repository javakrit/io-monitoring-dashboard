**io-monitoring-dashboard** is a minimal React dashboard for interacting with both Icinga2 and the WHM APIs. The application contacts the underlying [io-monitoring-proxy](https://github.com/valentinogagliardi/io-monitoring-proxy), gets the data by the means of a Socket.IO client and updates its state. Check out [Going real time with Socket.IO, Node.Js and React](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/socket-io-node-js-react/) for an introduction.
